# CS229 Final Project
Can My Paper Get Accepted? Automatic Paper Review using Machine Learning (Group Project with Xi Yan and Siyun Li)

Peer review is an integral part of scholarly publishing to determine the credibility and quality of a scientific work. However, in the past few years, the exponentially increasing submissions to prestigious scientific conferences have set a incredibly higher demand of workload for human reviewers. The growing amount of human labor required makes automatic paper review a tempting alternative. To this end, we study the use of machine learning algorithms to automate the paper review process. In this project, we formulate automatic paper review as a binary classification problem. We generate word embeddings for the input papers and combine them with hand-engineered features. We apply methodogically diverse machine learning algorithms to predict the peer review decision (i.e. accept or reject).
